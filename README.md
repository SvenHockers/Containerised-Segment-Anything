# Containerised Segment Anything

#### Containerised Segment Anything AI Using Docker for Flask framework. <br>
In this repository the <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything">Segment Anything</a> is containerised using <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker<a/> for a <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/">Flask</a> environment. This READMD.md is focussed of the development of the docker image and will be used during the project to take notes, gather documentation and highlight errors, limitation and (knowledge) gaps during developement.

To containerise Segment Anything first, a brief introduction of the Segment Anything AI should be establisched. After some research into Flask environements will be held to ensure the containerised version of Segment Anything will operate accordingly and finnaly some documentation w.r.t. Docker and containerisation of AIs should be discussed.
